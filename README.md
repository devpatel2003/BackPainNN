# Back Pain Classification using Neural Networks
## Overview
The "Back Pain Classification" project is a Python-based analytical tool designed to identify and label individuals as 'abnormal' or 'normal' using physical spine details. 
This project uses a dataset originally from the Kaggle "Lower Back Pain Symptoms Dataset". The main goal is to provide insights into lower back pain causes through the analysis of various spinal metrics.

## Key Features
Load and preprocess the "Dataset.csv" file.
Encode output classes and separate input features and target labels.
Split data into balanced training and test sets.
Z-standardize input features.
Implement neural network model.
Evaluate model using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.

Technologies Used: Python  
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Torch
